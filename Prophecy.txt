"The Prophecy"
The Emperor of Mist shall rule with his iron fist.  From his reign shall come the Hero of Baag-Ril.  The great paladin shall depose the emporer and take his crown.  His armies will sweep through the land and his unopposed rule will usher in an era of prosperity."

Our story begins.  The Hero has risen.  The hero of Baag-Ril has killed the emporer.  The capital, Medena, is ruined and in chaos.  Baag-Ril, as well, has suffered greatly.  The civil war has claimed roughly half its population - including more than 75% of its of young men.  In dire need to labor and material to rebuild and filled with ambition from the prophecy, the Temple sends emissaries to the outlying areas demanding surrender to rule under Baag-Ril and tribute.  The prophecy is well-known, compliance is virtually universal.  The people offer no resistance.  Still, however, repairing the damage and building an army conquer Mist requires more than the immediate vicinity can offer.  The temple sends its emissaries further out.  One arrives in the small city, Tash.

Our opening scene begins with that emissary's arrival.  He meets a group of serfs in the field.  They are of such lowly station they don't even have names.  A large one we come to know only as "Brother" offers the emissary a hearty greeting.  The emissary scoffs at being addressed directly by such a lowly individual and demands to speak with somene more important.  Brother tells him to "keep walking", the 'important people ' are in the city-proper.  The emissary threatens Brother and his lot in the field, then continues on his way.  The serf jabber a little and our scene closes.

That evening, 3 armed soldiers and the emissary approach the serfs.  The emissary declares that Baag-Ril wants this whole group for the mines, Brother first.  Brother demands an explaination, and the soldiers explain that Tash has elected to accept surrender.  10% of its people are to be handed over to Baag-Ril as slaves.

Brother laughs.  He says he'd prefer death.  As the soldier attempt to force him into shackles, another serf - our main character - grabs a pitchfork and stabs one of the soldiers in the back.  Distracted, a second soldier allows Brother to take his weapon and kill him with it.  3 more serfs join the fray and the remaining soldier and emissary find themselves outmatched.  As the 5 serfs advance, one stops them and volunteers as a slave - serfdom and slavery aren't vastly different and after spending a lifetime under the emperor's rule, this assignment may be an improvement.  Plus a the terms of surrender were clear and Tash couldn't possibly hold back the Hero.  The prophecy is clear.  Those who didn't resist follow him.  The emissary demands that the 5 be forced into slavery explicitly because of their resistance, but the 5 make it rather clear that the emissary lives only because they allow it.  He leaves with the slaves, afraid and angry.  Realizing their acts have made them criminals, Brother, our main character, and the three others gather what belongings they can carry and flee to the woods nearby.
